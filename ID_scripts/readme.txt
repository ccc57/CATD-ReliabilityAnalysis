The scripts in the folder "ID_code" provide examples of how to perform ID, permutation testing, and bootstrapping with the whole-brain connectivity matrix. Note that these scripts can also be adapted to perform network-based analyses (i.e. only using the edges within a specific network to peform ID).The ID and permutation testing code has been released previously, but for convenience we include it in the folder here. If using either of these two scripts in a publication please cite as:

The scripts in the folder "edge_code" provide examples of how to calculate the differential power and group consistency metrics, which are edges that are helpful and unhelpful in the ID process.

Questions regarding the usage of these scripts should be directed to Corey Horien (corey.horien@yale.edu).
